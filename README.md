Welcome to Brightspot CMS
=========================

Brightspot is an open source digital application development platform. It was built using the Dari Framework, a powerful object persistence library that makes it easy to build complex content types and persist them to one or more database backends.

Brightspot enables the creation of complex data models. Using simple annotations and standard Java types, anything can be modeled and accessed with a web view, or through an API. As a digital application development platform, Brightspot can be used as a publishing platform (CMS) for websites and native mobile applications, an application back-end, CRM and much more.
